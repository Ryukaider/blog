<h1>If I Made the New Paladin Heal</h1>
<h2>in World of Warcraft - 04/24/10</h2>

So we all know that Paladins have had 3 heals for 2 expansions now.  I have no idea how this slipped past all the Blizzard designers for over 4 years, but at least Cataclysm is giving Paladins new heals.  Basically Paladins need at least 2 new heals, one that does some sort of aoe heal, and one that is really useful in pvp.  Since they already announced healing hands for an aoe pve heal, I'm going to talk about what I think another new heal for pvp should be.
<br><br>
So here's my awesome idea for a Paladin heal.  It's got a cast time somewhere between 1-2 seconds.  It is mana inefficient.  So big mana for a moderate sized heal.  And if it is interrupted, only this spell gets locked out and the paladin becomes immune to silence and interrupts for x seconds.  Also casting this heal gives a short buff (like 2 seconds) that increase the healing done by the next holy shock.
<br><br>
Before you start saying this is the most overpowered thing you've ever read, you should actually read my entire explanation.  I promise it won't be too painful.  At least not as painful as frost strike in season 6.
<br><br>
So yeah here's all the ideas going on here:
<br><br>
For a long time I've been complaining that I want an instant cast heal because paladins get locked out so easily and the other healers have real nice instant heals.  Obviously druids and priests in particular can completely keep people alive in pvp using almost only instant casts.  Since the game has been released and gone through its expansions, Blizzard keeps adding more and more instant cast spells (or making talents to make other spells instant) compared to non-instants because they made it so easy to lock down casters that casters can often times only use instants.  Of all the classes, holy paladins in pvp probably rely the most on actual cast bars to cast their spells.  While I do still want another awesome (and overpowered) instant cast heal, I decided to keep the "theme" of the holy paladin by not making this one instant cast.
<br><br>
Right now the only downside to interrupting any spell of any class is that if you do, you can't interrupt their other school of magic.  Usually this means there's no downside to interrupt a spell.  If you see a spell being cast, you typically interrupt it.  So far in cataclysm, they are giving both moonkins and shadow priests a new spell that is in its own school of magic to make interrupts less devastating to those specs.
<br><br>
My spell combines that idea with another idea that they've done several times with dots now, which is that "stopping" the ability actually has a downside.  I refer to unstable affliction causing damage when dispelled and shadow word pain returning mana to the priest when dispelled.  So again, combining these two already existing design philosophies, I decided that this heal would be in it's own school of magic and when interrupted the paladin will become immune to silence and interrupts for a short duration.
<br><br>
I'm sure a lot of you are thinking this sounds really overpowered right now, "paladins immune to interrupt?  absolutely overpowered!"  Well here's why it's not.  You see the paladin casting the new heal, you don't interrupt it.  It is mana inefficient.  The paladin can use it to save people and keep them alive while not being interrupted, but using only this heal will guarantee the paladin goes oom in a medium to long length fight or arena match.  This also gives paladins a possible fighting chance against stupid things like double mage teams where a paladin has no possible chance to heal his partner but a resto druid will lol at the mages all day with instant casts.  Also note that the paladin can still be stunned and cc'd while casting this ability without the immunity proc'ing.  So things like polymorph will still own the paladin as usual.  Furthermore, if the person the paladin is healing is very low on hp, then it can be a good decision to interrupt the paladin anyway because it will still stop that heal and the paladin will need to get a different heal off to save the target.  So there will still be times when interrupting this heal is a good idea.  Also keep in mind that just the fact that a heal has a cast time can be very detrimental as it means the paladin isn't moving and can be easily outranged or los'd by the target.
<br><br>
Alright, so the ability also needed an effect to it that benefits pve, otherwise Blizzard would never put it in the game.  There's many possibilities for this, so they could make it whatever, but I did come up with an idea.  My idea is the heal gives a very short buff (like 2 seconds) that increases the healing done by the next holy shock.  So first, the pve problem solved by this is quick burst healing.  Right now in the cataclysm forums, the developers have mentioned wanting to change flash of light into a mana inefficient bigger heal with the same cast time, similar to flash heal of priests.  Since my ability is already mana inefficient and a cast time similar to flash of light, just adding on this holy shock bonus will make casting this heal a quick moderate heal + an extra big holy shock causing some nice quick burst healing (remember, paladins don't have natures swiftness!).  And then they wouldn't need to change flash of light from what it is currently.  What this also does is encourage the player to not spam this one spell because while this heal does not have a cooldown, holy shock does.
<br><br>
As far as keeping this buff balanced in pvp, that is the reasoning for it being so short (like 2 seconds).  Many times in pvp I'm using holy shock a lot, so I'm assuming other paladins do too.  That means there's a good chance that holy shock will already be on cooldown when the player casts this heal, and won't benefit from the buff it gives for holy shock.  Furthermore, the player can choose to "save" their holy shock in case they need it in combination with this heal, but that means they aren't using holy shock at other times in the battle when it might be very beneficial.  And again, if the paladin is spamming this heal, which they might need to do sometimes in pvp, then they are not getting the holy shock benefit from most of these casts.
<br><br>
Alright well that's my idea for now.  Let me know what you think.  Blizzard will probably just make an instant cast heal though, which will still make me happy, but it would be nice if everything in the game wasn't instant cast.  What's that... instant cast regrowth?  Don't get me started...
