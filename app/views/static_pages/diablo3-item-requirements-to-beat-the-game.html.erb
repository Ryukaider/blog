<h1>Item Requirements to Beat the Game</h1>
<h2>in Diablo III - 07/31/12</h2>

<h4>Introduction</h4>
<br>By beat the game, I mean be able to solo through all of inferno without doing something super cheesy.  I guess I'll start out by saying that I think the gear requirement is too high.  I feel like it isn't reasonably possible to beat the game without using the auction house, which I strongly believe it should be.  In my mind, there should be gear for beating the game and gear for farming the game.  The gear for beating the game should be much easier to get.  In Diablo III, I see gear for farming as gear that has magic find, gold find, and damage vs elites.  I think that most people don't try to get these stats before beating inferno, so that makes sense.  But the problem is that if you can get gear good enough to beat the game without these stats, then you can still farm very effectively with 0 magic find, gold find, and damage vs elites because of the valor stacks.  And because of that, I feel like Blizzard made the gear requirements to beat the game higher than they should be.
<br><br>
<h4>Video Example</h4>
<br>To help prove my point, I logged on real quick and made a video of me trying to fight an act 3 elite, which is where I'm currently stuck in inferno.  I can kill some elites in act 3, but not enough to be able to progress.  My stats are 820-1050 in each resist (with 1050 being physical), 8800 armor, 750 life on hit, and 16k dps.  This gear is obviously far from the best, but I spent a lot of time on the auction house to get it, and to upgrade any of the pieces now would be like 999999999999 gold per slot.  These stats are also much higher than my stats were when I beat act 2 inferno.  So the point is, I feel like I should be able to do act 3.  <%= link_to "Watch the video", 'http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sl4VtA-tJ84&feature=plcp', target: "_blank" %> and you will see how much effort I have to put into trying to kill one of these elites in act 3.  I also use two health potions in this video, and it is still unclear whether or not I would win without the lag spike.
<br><br>
I also want to point out that before Diablo III was released, Blizzard said that all skills would be viable, which obviously is not true.  No, I don't have a source at the moment because I don't want to watch/read hours of Diablo III stuff to find it.
<br><br>
Anyway, <u>I do not think that inferno difficulty should be nerfed</u> or anything.  After the nerfs done already, I think the difficulty is in a pretty good spot.  However, I do think that <%= link_to "elite affixes", '/diablo3/elite-affixes' %> should be looked at.  But this post is going to be about things related to items.  So here are a bunch of ideas that I think would make the game more reasonable to beat, but not easier to farm.  And yes, most are ideas from Diablo II.
<br><br>
<h4>Auction House Limitations</h4>
<br>One thing that I find limiting me in improving my gear is the 10 item auction house limit.  If I go and farm, I'm going to find a lot of sellable items.  I don't want to sell only items that sell for millions.  If I find a bunch of items that I know will sell for 50k each, I want to sell them for 50k each.  Those little items add up.  So once I farm and get a bunch of items to sell, I stop playing and wait for those items to sell as I slowly put them up each day on the auction house.  I can not farm as much as I want because I find items faster than I can sell them, if I want to keep selling the small items.  In Diablo II, I could just keep on farming and adding stuff to a big trade list on d2jsp.  Selling tons of items for 1-2 forum gold is how I got most of my gear in Diablo II.
<br><br>
<h4>A stat that is good for beating the game, but not farming</h4>
<br>In Diablo II there is a stat that I like to think is really good for beating the game, but not for farming.  That stat is integer damage reduction (damgge reduced by x, rather than damage reduced by x%).  Popular items for leveling a character though normal difficulty are the sigon set, which gives 7 integer damage reduction, and cathan's rings, which give 2 integer damage reduction each.  With these items, you take very little damage in normal difficulty.  In nightmare difficulty sometimes I am lucky enough to find a magic amulet with 25 integer damage reduction.  Using this and cathan's rings means taking very little damage throughout nightmare.  An amulet like this is also decent throughout hell difficulty, especially if it has another mod.  Similarly, a magic circlet could be with integer damage reduction and another mod.  This is a mod that I'm happy to see while playing through the game, but would never use when farming because it requires sacrifing too much of good farming stats.  This is mainly because unlike most mods, integer damage reduction only stands out on magic items.  For example, a magic amulet can have 25 integer damage reduction, while a rare amulet can only have 7.
<br><br>
I think that this is a good concept that could be applied to Diablo III.  I would like to see a stat that has the primary purpose of being used to beat the game, while being quite bad for farming.  It doesn't have to be anything like integer damage reduction from Diablo II, but for the sake of an example, let's just make up something similar that follows the same logic of being a defense stat like in Diablo II, while feeling like a good fit in Diablo III.  This would be a mod that reduces damage taken from elites.  Since it isn't magic find, gold find, or damage, it isn't a high priority stat for farming.  Now make it significantly better than the mod for dealing bonus damage vs elites, then have it only appear on magic items.  Only appearing on magic items makes it even worse for farming because you would have to give up more farming stats to get it.
<br><br>
<h4>Crafting</h4>
<br>In the beta, crafting had some items with a specific stat plus random mods, and some items with all random mods.  I really liked this idea, but in the release version there are only items with all random mods (there's some legendary recipes, but they seem not super easy to get).  I think adding back in some crafted items with specific mods would help out this problem of being able to actually beat the game.  This does two things.  It allows the player to make up for stats they are lacking from bad luck in drops, and it allows the player to be much less dependent on the auction house.  Crafting would also be a good way to get the new mod mentioned in the previous topic.
<br><br>
<h4>Economy and Exploits</h4>
<br>It's sad to say this, but most of the people who have a lot of gear and money are people who exploited things during the first few weeks of Diablo III before they were nerfed.  I get really depressed when I watch youtube videos and hear people talk about making 200 million gold in several days from exploits.  Now on the auction house, gear for being able to do act 1 inferno is pretty cheap.  But gear for being able to do acts 3 and 4 are roughly 9999999999999999 gold per slot.  The only people who can afford this are people who abused farming spots that were nerfed.  I wish I were exaggerating.  So I recommend that Blizzard goes back in time, then hires more testers before releasing the game.
<br><br>
<h4>Upgrading Items</h4>
<br>So in Diablo II, if you found a cool unique or rare item that you like in normal and nightmare, but haven't been lucky enough to find a replacement in hell, you could use runes and the horadric cube to upgrade these items to higher level versions.  They keep their exact mods, but the base damage/armor of the item increases to correspond to the higher level version.  Maybe Diablo III could have a similar system.  This might cause more problems than it's worth, but it's an idea.
<br><br>
<h4>Quest Rewards</h4>
<br>Once again, in our good friend Diablo II, you are guaranteed some items via quests.  In acts 1 and 3, you get a ring from a quest in each, which are rare in nightmare/hell.  Usually they are bad, but a few times they have been surprisingly good for me and usable throughout the game.  In act 4, you get some runes from the hellforge quest, which can often be the runes needed to upgrade items as described in the previous topic.  In act 5, you get a class specific rare item, which is always the worst rare item I have ever seen, but it's a good concept.  Also in act 5, you get the runes ral+ort+tal to make the runeword ancient's pledge, which can help a player struggling on resists.  Or these runes can be put in another item like a helm, for resists.
<br><br>
I think it would be a good idea to give some specific, but still random, items from some quests throughout the game to help the player along.  In particular, I think a class specific rare item like the Diablo II act 5 quest is a really good concept.  Rings from quests would also be nice because rings are ridiculous prices on the auction house, so we need more in circulation or something.
<br><br>
<h4>Enrage Timers</h4>
<br>Enrage timers do not belong in this game.  One reason is that they greatly increase the necessity for extremely good offensive stats on gear.  It's hard enough to get enough survivability in inferno, but items with excellent offensive and defensive stats are 999999999999 gold.  Why am I not allowed to play an extremely defensive character if I want?  It's an action RPG.  I shouldn't have to follow such strict gearing guidelines as World of Warcraft.  If it takes me a really long time to kill elites and bosses, my prize is beating the game, not getting loot efficiently.  It just sucks to take a long time to kill things, only to have it enrage, and get nothing out of all that effort.
<br><br>
<h4>Scaling Items</h4>
<br>Two quick examples from Diablo II are <%= link_to "angelic amulet+ring", 'http://classic.battle.net/diablo2exp/items/sets/sets1.shtml#angelic', target: "_blank" %> and <%= link_to "cleglaw's sword+gloves", 'http://classic.battle.net/diablo2exp/items/sets/sets2.shtml#cleglaws', target: "_blank" %>.  These are awesome examples of items that scale with level and stay useful from normal to hell difficulty.  Cleglaws sword has both percent based mods and a mod that scales with level.  Percent based mods cause the weapon to scale with stats from other gear.  So while this is not a great weapon in hell difficulty, it can still be used if nothing better is found.
<br><br>
I don't think that Diablo III has any scaling low level items like these, but I think they are fun and interesting, and most importantly, help the player beat the game without being so dependent on the auction house.
<br><br>
<h4>Charms</h4>
<br>Charms are a way to get small upgrades in Diablo II.  Maybe it's too difficult to get a big upgrade in one of your equipment slots, but it's likely that there is a lot of room for small upgrades in your charms.  Charms definitely kept Diablo II interesting for me, and allow the player to help in stats that they are lacking.  While charms are a hilariously flawed system, maybe Diablo III could have its own system that allows for easier small upgrades instead of 999999999999 gold items on the auction house.
<br><br>
<h4>Easy to obtain, but good, items</h4>
<br>At this point, I guess many of the other topics would be included in this idea.  However, there is one more example of what I think is the most notable easy to obtain, but good item in Diablo II, which is <%= link_to "smoke", 'http://diablo.wikia.com/wiki/Smoke_Rune_Word', target: "_blank" %>.  There are plenty other examples of this in Diablo II, but I think that Diablo III could use some more items that are easy to get and good for beating the game, but not good for farming, like smoke is in Diablo II.  Smoke is an item that you don't really want to use for farming, but is a common item to beat the game with.  I think this is a concept that Diablo III could use more of.
