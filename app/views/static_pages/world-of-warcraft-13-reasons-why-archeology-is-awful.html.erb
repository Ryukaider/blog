<h1>13 Reasons why Archeology is Awful<h1>
<h2>in World of Warcraft - 02/07/11</h2>

I have been doing a lot of archeology lately, and I came up with 13 reasons (in increasing awfulness) why I think that archeology is one of the worst and least thought-out professions I've ever seen in a game.
<br><br>
13. Zone ceilings.  Wow, when designing this profession and putting flying mounts into Azeroth, they really should have taken another look at the zone ceilings in Azeroth.  If you have ever tried flying in and out of Hyjal particularly, you know what I'm talking about.  Was I doing archeology?  I can't remember because all I hear is my dragon screaming in pain.
<br><br>
12.  The range on the green survey.  A lot of times the green survey will make sense.  I use it, walk a bit, and get the fragment.  But then many other times I walk the same amount, and another green survey appears pointing me back in the direction I came.  Then when I find the fragment, it was like 2 inches away from my first green survey.  Like seriously, what the hell.  I wish I had a screenshot of this to show how unbelievably little sense the range on this thing makes sometimes.  Every time this happens, it makes me so unnecessarily frustrated.
<br><br>
11. Mob corpses covering fragments.  Sometimes mobs will aggro you and if you kill some of the bigger ones, their corpses can completely cover where a new fragment appears.  It is very frustrating.
<br><br>
10. It isn't fun at all.  Being fun is rather important, but unfortunately there are 9 other things worse about it.  Sometimes I wish I was fishing instead.  Sometimes I do one dig site and just want to log off.  Doing archeology is so bad that it almost makes me want to play a game of HoN.
<br><br>
9. The false advertising of learning about the history of Azeroth.  Yeah, anyone who read about archeology before Cataclysm was released would know that they advertised it as finding artifacts to learn about the history of Azeroth.  This is simply not true.  They could have done so much more with this.
<br><br>
8. Level 60 epics.  I don't get it.  Is this a joke?  I'm trying to find a level 85 epic item and I get a level 60 epic robe.  Even if I were leveling a new char and it was level 60, I wouldn't use this item because heirlooms are better.  These items literally have no purpose in the game.  I wouldn't be so angry about it if archeology gave good items in addition to useless ones like this, but it's just all useless.
<br><br>
7. The skill level is meaningless.  Why does this profession have a skill level?  There are only 2 skill levels that matter.  Your skill level is either below 450 or above 450.  Usually skill levels indicate a slowly growing progression of something.  But that is not the case in archeology.  There is actually no difference between skill levels 450 and 525.  It's like Blizzard just put skill levels in this profession just to trick the players into thinking they were making some kind of real progression.
<br><br>
6. The survey sends you in the wrong direction.  Yeah I still don't get this.  The survey sends me in one direction, then the next survey will send me in a completely different direction.  Why did it not just send me that way in the first place?  Also, the survey will send you out of the dig site.  Man, that is really cool.  If I have to do this profession it would be nice if the survey actually made sense.
<br><br>
5. The "fun" items are awful.  So if you have done archeology, you may have noticed that there are a bunch of items that are suppose to be fun, in that they don't actually do anything to benefit your character.  Unfortunately, they are also not fun/interesting for the most part.  Examples of fun items:  items that transform your character for more than 20 seconds and allow you to cast while transformed, items that drop something on the ground that is interactive, items like crashin thrashin racer, items that summon something that does more than just follow you around, and items that put some effect/animation on another player.  Archeology is full of items that are intended to be fun, but sadly aren't.  They are mostly dumb, pointless, short duration things.  The only somewhat interesting item I have gotten so far is the wind chimes, and that is mostly because I can put them in a macro.
<br><br>
4. Commons are pointless.  I can't stress this enough.  A profession should not be giving you items that are 100% useless constantly and forever.  A profession is suppose to give you items starting at small usefulness that gradually increase in usefulness.  They are attempting to address this next patch by making them sell for reasonable amounts.  However, I could still make money 10x faster with skinning, and making money should be a side option with items from a profession, not the main and only option.  I am endlessly boggled by what they were thinking when designing this profession full of gray items.
<br><br>
3. Once you get the rares for a race, the fragments become 99.9% useless, but you still have to dig at those sites in order to get the dig sites you want.  So much is wrong here.  Professions are suppose to give things that are useful when obtained in multiples, like something consumable or tradable.  Archeology items "run out" but you are still forced to go to those dig sites in order to get other things.  If I have to do this terrible profession, why can't I just farm the dig sites that I want?
<br><br>
2. You basically get one item for doing archeology.  Yep, depending on your class, there will probably be exactly one actual useful item for you.  I have a holy paladin and an unholy death knight.  For my paladin, the night elf trinket is the only useful item, and happens to also be the best trinket in the game.  For my death knight, the only useful item would be zin'rokh, but I already have an arena weapon.  Since I don't make alts, there is exactly one useful item for me.  You might try to claim that there are mounts and pets, but everything in WoW does, so when looking at something it is more like "what do I get from this other than pets and mounts?"  Also the pets and mounts are only for people that actually want them... since you know, you can't even use those 100 mounts and 150 pets you have anyway.
<br><br>
1. The randomness. I have been doing nothing but archeology on WoW recently, trying to obtain <%= link_to "Tyrande's Favorite Doll", 'http://www.wowhead.com/spell=91757', target: "_blank" %>. At the moment I have found the other 6 of 7 Night Elf rare artifacts, and then also completed 70 more commons after that.  Very few things have been this frustrating to me in a video game before.  I have farmed 3 dark whelplings, the eye of shadow, orb of the darkmoon, and probably some other ridiculous things.  Being extremely random makes sense for things like pets.  It does not make sense for gear that you actually need.
