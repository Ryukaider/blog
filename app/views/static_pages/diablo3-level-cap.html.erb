<h1>Level Cap</h1>
<h2>in Diablo III - 07/28/12</h2>

I don't like how experience and the level cap are designed in Diablo III, such that you are supposed to easily reach the level cap, and can't even start the last difficulty before reaching the level cap.  I'm going to talk about some reasons why.
<br><br>
<h4>In Diablo II...</h4>
<br>Getting to level 99 in Diablo II is the definition of an achievement before achievements were in games.  It is more or less a trophy.  Most characters are be "complete" by level 90 in that you have enough stat points and skill points to finish the important parts of your build.  Getting from 90 to 99 is mostly a small increase in stats, with skill points probably going into a passive skill.  There is very little difference between a level 90 and a level 99 character.  The gear and the player are much more important than that level difference.  And in pvp (the very hilarious pvp), it is not uncommon for a level 70 to kill a level 80 or a level 80 to kill a level 90.
<br><br>
Actually getting to level 99 though... well it gets more ridiculous than anything you have seen in a game before after level 95.  It literally takes a month to get from 98 to 99.  Well I just <%= link_to "looked up the number crunch", 'http://diablo2.diablowiki.net/Guide%3aHigh_Level_Baal_Runs_to_99_v1.10,_by_jjscud_and_Reborn', target: "_blank" %> for exp required to get level 99, and I almost want to say that it's too ridiculous.  Apparently when you reach level 90, you are .36% of the way to level 99.  When you reach level 98, you are 36.6% of the way to level 99 (so you can level up two characters from 1-98 faster than leveling one character to 99).
<br><br>
Anyway, what I like about this is that most players are not the max level.  Most players don't even consider getting to level 99 as an option.  You don't even get to 99 for the stats.  You get to 99 to show you love that character and love the game.  But I think it's awesome to be able to look at a character that you've been playing for so long, and consider to be complete, and know that it can still gain more stats.
<br><br>
<h4>Ladder</h4>
<br>I'm a little surprised at the lack of ladder in Diablo III.  It of course makes sense since everyone gets to level 60 eventually, but I thought that Blizzard liked having ladders.  I love the concept of the ladder, and I know many other players do as well.  Simply by having a ladder, I'm pretty sure many more people would be addicted to the game instead of playing for a while and then tossing it aside.  Plus it stirs competition and forum discussions.
<br><br>
Honestly, if I made an action RPG, I probably wouldn't have a level cap at all.  How mind blowing is that?  Instead of the designers telling me when my character is done, I decide when my character is done.  I would just love it if Diablo III characters didn't have a level cap at all.  After reaching level 60, you would have all of your skills and runes unlocked, and the vitality scaling would stop.  Each level after 60 would continue getting exponentially harder, and quickly become very unreasonable.  And all you would gain for leveling up would be a few points to the four main stats, which wouldn't really be worth it... except for the ladder.  Yeah, that would be sweet.
<br><br>
<h4>EXP Gear</h4>
<br>When I played the beta and saw bonus exp as an item mod, I got really excited.  I thought this was an awesome idea because Diablo II only had two items that gave bonus exp, so it wasn't exactly a stat that you could stack.  However, after playing Diablo III, I realized how quickly and easily it is to get max level, along with it being required to finish the game.  This realization caused the bonus exp mod to plummet from interesting and a thought provoking option in gear choice to a completely useless mod that is actually a waste to have on an item.  No, that's not an exaggeration.  Yes, bonus exp will help you level faster, but even with 0 bonus exp you will reach max level without much trouble.
<br><br>
The only situation that I can think of where I would actually aim to get this stat on gear is if I were trying to make some godly full +exp with reduced level requirement set of gear to use for leveling up many characters.  But you have to consider that the most characters you are going to level up is probably 5 (before expansions I guess), because you don't really need more than one of each class in Diablo III.  Also, I kind of like playing the game untwinked.  I think it would be really cool to see people with end game gear that has +exp on it, if they are someone who has max level as their goal.
<br><br>
<h4>"At least I got EXP"</h4>
<br>Once you beat the game, you keep playing to farm for items.  That is what you are thinking about when farming, items.  But with a Diablo II style level cap, you also get experience as a secondary perk.  I remember many times of killing a boss and getting no good items, but saying "at least I got exp."  In Diablo III, when I kill a boss and get no good items, I just get mad.  By still getting exp, you will randomly gain levels while farming, which is a really awesome feeling.  It can just really pick you up if you are on a bad farming streak.
<br><br>
This also adds another layer to farming.  Do I want to farm things that give better drops but worse exp?  Better exp but worse drops?  Or the best balance of the two?
<br><br>
<h4>Potential Problems</h4>
<br>Since it seems like such a good idea to me to have either a Diablo II style level cap, or no level cap at all, I want to think about possible problems caused by using one of these systems.
<br><br>
The biggest problem that I came up with is that I think many players would have a difficult time grasping the concept of they aren't meant to get to max level.  Ever since World of Warcraft, it's like every game has to follow the formula of reaching max level before end game.  I think that a majority of Diablo III players are primarily World of Warcraft players and go into Diablo III expecting this idea of reaching max level before inferno because that's what makes sense to them.  Without a level cap, they might be confused and start asking what level they are "supposed" to be to do inferno.  If they struggle in inferno, then they might feel that they are underleveled and have to farm to gain seemingly impossible levels in order to do inferno (this relates to another article that I'm going to write - about the gear required to beat inferno).  People would have to understand that it's not like World of Warcraft where the difference between an enemy 2 levels higher and 3 levels higher completely changes the game.  Up in the ladder section I mentioned that players would have all of their skills/runes and vitality scaling would stop after level 60.  So that would hopefully be enough indication to players that they have reached the end game point.
<br><br>
This idea of ending skills/runes and vitality scaling at level 60 actually introduces kind of another problem.  Any level after 60 would feel much weaker than previous levels.  I think that is kind of weird.  As a player, I would expect the levels to keep progressing my character equally to previous levels.  I still like the idea, it's just that the stat/skill system in Diablo II was more designed to fit into a system like this.  I don't know if there is a better solution or maybe I'm over-thinking it being a problem.  It makes sense to me, I just think it might not make as much sense to other players.
<br><br>
There are probably more things that I'm not factoring into this that would cause problems, such as resistance scaling, but I do think that everything could be designed around no level cap.  And of course item level requirements are another factor, but no items should require ridiculous levels.  I think the highest level requirement in Diablo II was 87 (but I do feel obliged to mention <%= link_to "constricting ring", 'http://forums.d2jsp.org/topic.php?t=35876642&f=138', target: "_blank" %>).
