<h1>Dungeoneering</h1>
<h2>in Runescape - 07/09/10</h2>

Runescape isn't a game that I plan to talk about much, but I recently played it again because I saw a new addition called dungeoneering.  I was so impressed by this new skill that I think it deserves a post.
<br><br>
So if you know anything about Runescape, you might know that EVERYTHING about it is extremely repetitive.  They also rarely add new F2P content over the many years the game has existed.  And finally, the game has always lacked group based boss encounters.  Well dungeoneering solves all of these things and more.  Also this post is from a F2P perspective.
<br><br>
If you don't know what dungeoneering is exactly, it is a zone that contains 35 floors.  Each floor is essentially a new dungeon, and you must clear each floor to have access to the next one.  You are not allowed to bring any items or equipment into the dungeon, which is interesting.  The exception is you can bind one (or more at high levels of dungeoneering) dungeoneering specific item to your character that is always brought with you.  Dungeoneering is meant to completely use your abilities.  Each floor of the dungeon is made up of a grid of rooms.  Each room can contain a combination of enemies, puzzles, gatherable items, keys, and doors to new rooms.  One room contains a boss, and once the boss is defeated, you can exit the floor to receive dungeoneering exp and move on to the next floor.  The more players in the group, the harder the dungeon is, the more rooms there are, and the more exp you get.  Many doors and puzzles also require certain levels of skills to open or complete, such as woodcutting to chop open a covered door or magic to activate a piece of a puzzle.  You can use other skills like smithing and fishing/cooking to make gear and food for yourselves, which come in limited amounts per floor.  Anyway, you can read more about it at the wiki or official site or something.

Now about what I think is really good about dungeoneering.  So first I mentioned that everything about Runescape is extremely repetitive.  Well some people might say that dungeoneering is also very repetitive, but in comparison to the rest of the game it really isn't.  There is a decent amount of randomity each time you go in.
<br><br>
Next, there hasn't been any "real" group based content in Runescape F2P up to this point that I've seen.  These days, some sort of group and dungeon system seems mandatory in MMORPGs.  Well one cool thing about dungeoneering is that you can do it with whatever number of people you want.  Well I don't know what the max is, like 5 I think.  But anywhere from 1-max, and the game scales the dungeon appropriately to the number of people in your group.  However, you get more exp with more players in the group, so that is encouraged.  I really like this because it allows you do dungeoneer whenever you want, with whoever you want, or by yourself.  I also really like two player content, but two player content is something that you rarely see in MMOs, but works great with dungeoneering.
<br><br>
Next I want to mention bosses.  Bosses seems like a key component to a good MMO, but Runescape never really had any before.  Not only that, but these bosses are the first encounters that I've seen in Runescape where you actually do something other than auto attack.  I wasn't expecting this, so I was impressed that they finally made somewhat interesting boss encounters.  Now despite saying that, several of the boss encounters are just annoying/frustrating due to the way that movement works in Runescape combined with lag, but the point is that it's a big step in the right direction.
<br><br>
Another major part of dungeoneering is the use of skills.  You literally need to use almost every skill while dungeoneering.  You need mining/smithing to make gear, since you start out with no equipment other than your one binded item.  You need firemaking/cooking to make food.  Then you'll need random other skills like prayer, woodcutting, and strength to open some doors.  And sometimes you will need to use another skill like magic to activate a puzzle.  I really like that they were able to create something that uses all the abilities in the game.  Also, you get exp for each skill when you use it in dungeoneering, so that's cool.  You can level up all your skills while dungeoneering, but in a less grindy fasion (and much less efficiently).
<br><br>
Well I mentioned puzzles, so I should talk about that.  Dungeons don't have to be all about killing enemies.  Dungeoneering also tosses puzzles at you randomly.  I like this because it feels "dungeony" and means that you aren't constantly doing the same thing.  Although some of the puzzles can be very annoying.
<br><br>
I think the last thing that I want to mention is the fact that each room can have extremely varying strengths of enemies.  There could be level 2 enemies and enemies that are higher level than you in the same room.  I really like this because it's something you never see in other MMOs, but again, it feels very "dungeony."  Enemies shouldn't all be equal strength in a dungeon in my opinion.  I think it helps to keep you interested when you fight a few weak enemies, start getting careless, then walk into a guy that hits you for half your health (rough estimate).

So to wrap this up, by doing dungeoneering you get a special currency (tokens) that you can use to buy some really awesome F2P items.  And while Runescape doesn't have the smooth movement and cameras of a game like World of Warcraft, I think that dungeoneering was an excellent addition to the game and they put some good ideas into it.
