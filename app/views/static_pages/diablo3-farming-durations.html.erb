<h1>Farming Durations</h1>
<h2>in Diablo III - 07/23/12</h2>

In D2, all farming was short duration.  You actually couldn't farm the same game for more than like 10 minutes unless you killed everything worth killing across all acts, and even then it wouldn't take much longer.  I really liked that I could login to D2 and clear the chaos sanctuary in 3 minutes, because sometimes I only had 3 minutes to play.  There are very few games that you can play for only 3-10 minutes and be productive.  In fact, it's so awesome that I'm going to log into my wind druid I made years ago and kill Diablo, brb... yeah! found a pus spitter, what a hilarious unique.  But one of my complaints about D2 was that there was no long duration content to farm if I wanted to farm for more than a few minutes without starting a new game.

D3 fixed this with valor stacks.  I like the stacks system, however it caused the opposite problem of D2, which is that you can only farm long duration, and there is nothing short duration to farm.  It is not an option for me to play D3 for only 10 or less minutes like it was with D2.  If I only have 10 minutes to play, I just don't play, which makes me a little sad.  Since I like the stacks system, I don't think that should be changed at all.  But I think there should be SOMETHING that is worth farming for 10 or less minutes.  It would generally not be as good as stacks farming, but be an option for people who don't want to clear a whole act.
