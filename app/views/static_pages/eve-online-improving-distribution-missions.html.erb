<h1>Improving Distribution Missions</h1>
<h2>in EVE Online - 05/05/13</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3><br>
I think that distribution missions (also commonly called "courier" missions) are one of the weakest elements in EVE from a design perspective, but also have a lot of potential. Most EVE players have done a few distribution missions until they quickly realize that nothing significant ever changes about them, and the players move to other activities. Some problems with distribution missions are they are very simple, require minimal attention and effort, and boring in general. Even people who mine, which is often considered one of the most boring activities, consider distribution missions to be too boring.

<br><br>
<h3>Using the right ship/modules for the right mission</h3><br>
I believe that EVE is more fun when the player has to think about and choose the right ship for the right job. Currently for distribution missions, industrial ships are mostly the only type of ship used, and the only module they need is some expanded cargoholds. My suggestions below are ideas that would make it so each distribution mission has different ships/modules to do them the most effectively. However, most of the missions would still be completable using one properly fit Iteron Mark V for example, but a player who switches ships/modules appropriately for each mission would complete them more efficiently.
<br><br>Since these suggestions require different skills and modules, they should be focused more into the higher level distribution missions. Level 1 distribution missions can remained unchanged, while some of the suggestions below become added to the mission pool each time the agent level increases.
<br><br>Introducing the idea of distribution missions that involve dropping the cargo off in deadspace opens a lot of opportunities for improvement. Also note that all of these mission ideas would still require traveling at least a few jumps before reaching the deadspace acceleration gate, to keep the idea of being courier missions.
<br><br>Since another important part of EVE is player interaction, I try to keep this in mind with a few of the ideas as well.

<h3>Some suggestions to improve distribution missions</h3><br>
<li><strong>More dynamic time-based rewards.</strong> Currently for all types of missions, you either get the time bonus or you don't. But I think that for distribution missions it should be a little more dynamic because delivering things faster for a better reward just makes sense. So I think it would be good if the bonus reward started out higher than it does currently, but decreased by a small amount each second until eventually becoming zero. This would discourage people from using autopilot for distribution missions, where in the current system the time bonus can often be achieved while using autopilot. This would make distribution missions more rewarding for the player putting in more effort, and would make them a bit more exciting. Additionally, it would encourage the player to use their fastest ship that can fit the cargo instead of using the same industrial ship every time.</li>
<br><li><strong>A mission where the cargo deals damage to the ship over time.</strong> When the ship is undocked and carrying the mission cargo, the ship will take a set amount of damage from the cargo each second. When the ship is docked at any station, it will stop taking damage. This would be explained in the mission text. The damage would easily be negated by using a ship with a good buffer tank or active repairers. This type of mission would also encourage other players to attack the mission running ship if they see that it is already weakened.</li>
<br><li><strong>A mission where the cargo is brought to deadspace and the player is attacked by pirate NPCs.</strong> By having distribution missions drop their cargo in deadspace, there could be a mission where the player is attacked by some very weak pirate NPCs that could be defeated with almost any weapon, but it means having some form of a weapon equipped. The cargo can not be dropped off until the pirates are defeated. The mission text would explain this.</li>
<br><li><strong>A mission where the cargo is brought to deadspace and the dropoff is far away.</strong> The player would use an acceleration gate and the dropoff location would be something like 20-50 km away. This would encourage the player to use an afterburner or microwarp drive to complete the mission more efficiently.</li>
<br><li><strong>A mission where the cargo is brought to deadspace and requires a codebreaker.</strong> Similar to the previous suggestions, the player would take an acceleration gate to deadspace. The dropoff point for the cargo would be located there but would first require being hacked by a codebreaker before the cargo could be dropped off. This would be mentioned in the mission text.</li>
<br><li><strong>A mission where the player must scan the dropoff location using probes.</strong> The location would be different each time so that a bookmark could not be used.</li>
<br><li><strong>A mission that can only be completed using a certain class of ship.</strong> Maybe either a small/medium/large ship or more specifically need to be one of frigate/destroyer/cruiser/battlecruiser/battleship.</li>
<br><li><strong>A mission where the player must pass off the mission cargo to another player to complete.</strong> Of all the suggestions, this would be the most difficult to implement, but it would add player interaction to distribution missions. The player would accept the mission and have to bring the cargo to a specific station (probably a trade hub). At that station, the player would have to find a second player to trade the cargo to. The second player then brings the cargo to the dropoff point to complete the mission for both players. If the second player fails the mission, both players lose standing.</li>
<br><li><strong>A mission with a high sec route and low sec route.</strong> There may already be missions like this, I'm not sure, but the idea is that the player can choose to complete the distribution mission using high sec systems or much faster using low sec systems. For example, the route might be 8 jumps through high sec or 4 jumps through low sec.</li>
