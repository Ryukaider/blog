<h1>The List of Things that Don't Fool Around</h1>
<h2>in Diablo II - 11/10/10</h2>

So since I play hardcore on Diablo II, it is important to know what things in the game do not fool around (aka kill you instantly).  Some of my friends recently started playing hardcore, and I often refer to things in the game as being on the list of things that don't fool around.  However, this list actually did not exist up until now.  So here it is.
<br><br>
<font color="red">#1 Nihlithak</font> - Against Nihlithak your health only has two amounts, full and zero.  He is the definition of killing you instantly.  The reason that he is so deadly is because he casts corpse explosion on nearby corpses of monsters.  Since most of Diablo II is about aoe'ing down all the monsters, that means a lot of corpses will be in one place, and it will likely only take a few corpse explosions to kill you.  Without corpse explosion, he doesn't really do anything, and he also has low health so dies easily.  Avoiding death against him is easy if you are an inferior melee class that doesn't instantly kill everything on the screen.  Thus, you can simply walk past all the monsters and melee Nihlithak down in two hits.  If you are an overpowered spellcaster, you will probably need a nature's peace for the "slain monsters rest in peace" effect.
<br><br>
<font color="red">#2 The serpents on Nihlithak's floor</font> - I haven't actually been to Nihlithak's floor in 2 years because I don't want to die, but the last time I was there, some serpent type monsters could spawn there that had a bugged attack.  They shoot a poison dagger type ability that leaves a trail of poison behind.  The attack doesn't do much damage, but it is bugged so that basically every pixel you move in this poison will cause you to take damage from the attack again.  So running through it will cause you to take many hits very fast, and can also kill you roughly instantly.  If you ever go here, you may notice that your mercenary dies faster than you have ever seen to this attack.
<br><br>
<font color="red">#3 Undead dolls + amp</font> - Amp refers to the amplify damage curse, which reduces your physical resistance by 100%.  Even with damage reduction gear, it is not realistic to get close to 150% damage reduction in order to counter amplify damage, making it the most dangerous effect in the game.  When undead dolls die, they explode, causing 10% of their max health in damage.  This is pretty much the strongest physical attack in the game, so when combined with amp, it is the most physical damage you can take from a single attack.  The explosion can be blocked and dodged with defense, and one explosion won't kill you either.  But the undead dolls always come in packs, and if they all get aoe'd down and die at the same time, then taking 3 or so hits from their explosions can easily kill you instantly.
<br><br>
<font color="red">#4 Gloams + conviction</font> - Gloams, aka burning souls, aka lost souls or black souls or whatever else they are known as.  These monsters deal the highest amount of elemental damage in the game by far.  If you have max lightning resist and a thundergod's vigor, they do almost no damage to you.  If you have max lightning resist without any lightning absorb, they do significant damage to you.  If you don't have max lightning resist, they will kill you rather quickly.  If you have negative lightning resist, they will kill you instantly.  Conviction lowers all of your resists (and defense), more from higher level monsters.  Conviction combined with any type of monster that does big elemental damage can be extremely dangerous.  But since gloams do the most damage of all, they are the scariest to watch out for.
<br><br>
<font color="red">#5 Death Lords + amp + another mod from the mods that don't fool around list</font> - Death Lords by themselves are only really a threat if you are just getting to act 5 for the first time on an untwinked character.  However, if there is a pack of them with cursed and another mod that doesn't fool around (see below), then they don't care what class you are or what your gear is, they will hurt.  They probably do the most physical DPS in the game.  If you don't know, they are the big guys that dual wield axes and they use an ability called frenzy which makes them attack AND MOVE faster each time that they consecutively attack.  The movement speed is important because it makes them extremely difficult to run away from and they have a ton of health and just do a ton of DPS.
<br><br>
<font color="red">#6 Any unique boss pack with 2-3 of the following mods that don't fool around, in the appropriate situations</font> -
<br><font color="008000">Cursed:</font> This applies the amplify damage curse when you are struck. This curse has been mentioned above and is in general the most dangerous effect that a monster can have. Since it only affects physical damage, this only applies to monsters that do physical damage (note that monsters which don't do physical damage can be cursed).
<br><font color="008000">Convcition aura:</font> This has also been mentioned above, and is in general the second most dangerous effect that a monster can have. Similarly, this only applies to monsters which do elemental damage (note that monsters which don't do elemental damage can have conviction).
<br><font color="008000">Extra strong:</font> Adds more physical damage on top of another effect like cursed.
<br><font color="008000">Fanaticism aura:</font> Adds more physical damage on top of another effect like cursed.
<br><font color="008000">Might aura:</font> Adds more physical damage on top of another effect like cursed.
<br><font color="008000">Mana burn:</font> This only applies if you are a build that relies heavily on having mana for survivability.
<br><br>
Note that there are several superuniques throughout the game that ALWAYS fall into this category with cursed+extra strong, such as Lord de Seis (also always has fanaticism aura), the superunique in the ruined temple, and the one at the end of the spider cavern.
<br><br>
Also note that this depends a lot on the type of monster.  Fallens with the listed mods probably still won't give you a hard time.  Also, archers with the listed mods can often be particularly dangerous.
<br><br>
<font color="red">#7 Like 15+ Succubus in one spot</font> - The Succubus monsters are usually not too scary, and usually die easily.  However, sometimes there are randomly like 15 of them all in one spot.  At that point they no longer play by the rules and getting hit by 15 of their projectiles at once will hurt.  The projectiles are suppose to be blockable and dodgable (from defense), but for some reason I feel like they hit more than they should.  Also they can always cast amp without being a cursed unique, and their attack is physical damage (not fire!).
<br><br>
<font color="red">#8 Coldworm the Burrower + cold enchanted</font> - I have to put this on the list simply because I had a character die to it.  It was a level 41 untwinked wolf druid in nightmare.  I was at full health and when I killed Coldworm, the cold enchanted effect one shot me.  I don't remember my stats, but I remember being extremely surprised.  I have only had 3 characters die in PvM.  Two died to lag, and this was the third.  Needless to say, I never fool around with Coldworm anymore.
<br><br>
<font color="red">#9 Things with charge</font> - This refers to two types of monsters, defiled warriors (as in the ones around Pindleskin), and claw vipers (note these also spawn in act 5).  Most of the time these monsters do fool around, but once in a while you will get charged by like 10 at once and your character will decide not to block and you can instantly die.  Also in addition to charging, the claw vipers can shoot bone spears, which are all magic damage.  Since there are so few items in the game with magic absorb, magic damage is always going to do at least some damage to you.  So occasionally their combination of charge damage and bone spear damage can cause very quick death.
<br><br>
To summarize, the only things that you should really die to in hardcore are Nihlithak, amp, conviction, and lag.  Anything that is not on this list you really shouldn't die to unless it is something that I forgot to add.
<br><br><br>
<h3>The following are things that don't fool around only if you are playing an untwinked character:</h3>
<br>
<font color="red">Diablo on normal difficulty</font> - Unless you have really good fire resist, lightning resist and block, all of his attacks will probably do massive damage to you.
<br><br>
<font color="red">Unique boss packs of Disfigured/Misshapens</font> - These guys just don't play by the rules.  No matter what mods they have, they somehow make it deadly.
<br><br>
<font color="red">Flayer Shamans in Act 3 inferno</font> - Yeah, if you aren't twinked with big fire resist, they can definitely leave you staring at your computer screen wondering what just happened.
<br><br>
<font color="red">Things that are cold enchanted</font> - I feel like cold enchanted things do a very random amount of damage.  Sometimes they will do almost no damage, and sometimes they will do half my health.  Either way, I like to not risk taking the damage.  Once you get a raven frost, you never have to worry about the damage from cold enchanted monsters again.
<br><br>
<font color="red">Things that are lightning enchanted</font> - I think you understand this one without it being explained.
