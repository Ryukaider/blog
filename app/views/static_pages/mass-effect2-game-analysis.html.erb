	Mass Effect 2 for the PC is a third person role playing and action game with many interesting design choices.  The gameplay of Mass Effect 2 is centered around its story, but combat and exploration are also large parts of the game, with the choice being up to the player of how much to delve into each of these three areas.  The most defining feature in Mass Effect 2 is its paragon/renegade morality system and how that affects the story.  While this is a great topic to analyze, I would prefer to look at some of the less obvious game mechanics.
<br><br>
	The combat systems of most RPGs are made up of many parts that can be analyzed individually to an extent.  One design concept that must be handled delicately in a game like Mass Effect 2 is how to encourage the player to use both weapons and abilities, but to also use all of their weapons and all of their abilities.  Unlike the original Mass Effect where the player specializes in one weapon type, Mass Effect 2 allows the player to easily specialize in at least several weapon types.  While any weapon can generally be used with success in a given situation, there is always a weapon that is better in the given situation than the others.  Sometimes it is only slightly better, and other times it is significantly better.  This encourages, but does not require, the player to use all weapons in his arsenal.  Abilities are strong in general, especially when ranked up, which is enough encouragement for the player to use them.  In fact, they are strong enough that BioWare decided to put a shared cooldown on every single ability.  This is a debatable decision because while having abilities with shared cooldowns is a useful design tool, they might have overextended the feature.  For example, shared cooldowns can allow the player to have to choose between several abilities that have a similar function, or several exceptionally powerful abilities.  However in general, having every single ability on a shared cooldown is not a good idea because it is so limiting in several aspects.  In this case though, the shared cooldowns ensure that the player will be switching back to a weapon.  A mechanic that encourages the player to switch from using a weapon to an ability is that if an ability is used while a weapon is being reloaded, the reload animation is canceled and replaced by the ability animation, which causes the weapon to instantly reload.  Animation canceling exists in many games, serving different purposes.  One notable game that includes animation canceling is Street Fighter 4.  Animation canceling is often an unintended game mechanic, but whether or not it was purposely implemented in Mass Effect 2, it encourages the player to use an ability once a clip runs out.
<br><br>
	Another of the most important combat concepts in RPGs, including Mass Effect 2, is survivability, specifically the health bar.  There are countless ways among RPGs to recover a character's health bar, and while Mass Effect and Mass Effect 2 are very similar games, they take extremely different approaches towards recovering health.  This sparks the curiosity of analyzing why a game company might take such a different design approach to something in two similar games.  In Mass Effect there are three main ways to regain health/shields in a battle:  first aid (uses a consumable and has a cooldown), armor upgrades that give passive health regeneration, and certain abilities (such as an ability to regenerate x% of shields over 2 seconds).  In Mass Effect 2, the primary way to regain health/shields is to take cover for a few seconds, at which point they quickly regenerate (similar to Halo games).  Both of these designs have advantages and disadvantages.
<br><br>
	The Mass Effect health design allows for a large spectrum of gameplay.  At one end of the spectrum, a player can utilize all three methods of health regeneration, requiring constant thinking, cooldown management, and fighting style adjustments in an attempt to optimally keep the character alive while fighting.  This can allow for a compelling and thrilling gameplay experience.  However, all of the health regeneration methods are options, which means that a player doesn't necessarily have them.  A player can choose to use other armor upgrades over the passive health regeneration upgrades and sell those unwanted ones, choose all offensive abilities over defensive ones, and run out of the consumable for first aid.  Playing the game in this way might cause the player to feel like the game is impossible at certain points.  The player won't feel like it is his fault, because all he did was make decisions when the game offered them.  The player might also reluctantly turn to the Internet for answers, to learn that he should have been using health regeneration armor upgrades instead of something else.  Mass Effect 2 reduces the extremes on both ends of this spectrum by simplifying the system to taking cover to regenerate health/shields.  This completely eliminates the possibility of the player being unable to regenerate health based on customization decisions.  So the player does not need to be paranoid about making "wrong" decisions.  While Mass Effect 2 also loses some of the positives that the Mass Effect health system had, some people might argue that it is outweighed by losing the negatives, that Mass Effect 2 makes up for it with compelling and thrilling gameplay in other areas of combat, or that BioWare intended for the player not to focus so much on defense.
<br><br>
	While Mass Effect 2 has many different combat abilities which could each be analyzed, there is one ability that stands out among the others in terms of the number of game mechanics that affect it, and how many design decisions went into it.  This ability is called "Charge" and is used by the Vanguard class, which specializes in melee attacks.  This ability will instantly charge into a targeted enemy, knocking them down and causing damage, as well as restoring some of the player's shield.  This may sound like a somewhat simple ability at first, but there are actually a lot of game mechanics affecting this ability, with much to understand.  For starters, the cooldown of Charge is only 6 seconds, which is a similar cooldown to other common abilities in Mass Effect 2.  In other games, an ability like Charge might designed as a once per battle initiation ability, but Mass Effect 2 does not have an abundance of abilities per class, so the 6 second cooldown works well to make it an initiation ability while having many other uses as well.  Charge is advertised by the interface and tooltips as an offensive ability, but it actually has useful offensive, defensive, and maneuverability traits.  For offense, it does damage to the target, instantly puts the player into melee range which allows for melee attacks and effective shotgun usage, and knocks the target down which allows for easy additional attacks.  From a defensive perspective, the ability will restore a percentage of shields, knock down an enemy which means that enemy isn't attacking, and can be used to escape dangerous situations by charging to a lone enemy.  Another interesting mechanic to note about Charge is how the knock down effect differs based on the type and size of the enemy.  Some enemies will be knocked down, others will stumble backwards but not fall down, and others will seem completely unaffected and remain stable.
<br><br>
	When designing an ability like Charge, one of the most important mechanics to determine is when the ability will be usable.  If the target has one foot behind a box, should it be usable?  If there is a small object in the path between the player and target, should it be usable?  Where are the lines drawn and how stubborn should the game be about allowing a Charge?  In Mass Effect 2's case, if the target is clearly not taking cover, and a path is available, then Charge is almost always allowed.  Additionally, even though an available path is required, the character does not actually take that path, but instead goes in a straight line to the target, passing through any objects.  The available path is necessary of course so that the player doesn't make a one way Charge that is impossible to walk back from.  These conditions to use the ability are certainly on the generous side, in that if it is off cooldown and the player attempts to use it on a target, there will rarely be an issue.  However, the requiring a path but taking a straight line mechanic of Charge opens endless possibilities of exploiting the ability.  While I did not extensively test the ability for possible exploits, I don't think there are any seriously overlooked exploits such as immediately skipping to the end of a mission.  Mostly it can only be used to avoid some pathing that might save the player 10 or so seconds of running.  There is one unusual, and almost surely unintended, area in the game where Charge does not function as expected though.  In this area, the player moves onto a platform as additional platforms carrying enemies float in and connect to each other.  The player can walk from one platform to the next with no noticeable problems, but although using Charge while targeting an enemy on a different platform is allowed, the player does not actually move anywhere after the Charge animation completes and the player receives the shield restoration.
<br><br>
	One idea worth noting about the shield regeneration of Charge is that it can create "win more" situations.  This is a term sometimes used by Magic: The Gathering players to describe a situation where a strategy only starts working when the player would win anyway.  An example of a "win more" design is the snowballing items in League of Legends, such as Mejai's Soulstealer, which increase stats every time that an enemy player is killed, and reduce stats every time the player dies.  Charge can create a "win more" situation when the enemies in a battle are weak enough that they inflict less damage to the player than amount of shield that Charge regenerates every 6 seconds from reusing the ability.  Once this situation begins, the battle is already decided because it is impossible for the player to die.  Each additional enemy killed only causes the player to win with even more shields remaining, while in a normal situation even one enemy remaining has the possibility of killing the player.  To summarize the idea, these kinds of game mechanics on an ability make easy enemies even easier while not affecting the difficulty of strong enemies.  "Win more" situations are not necessarily bad design, and it can sometimes be fun to have them, but it is worth analyzing them because they are often created unintentionally.  However, this idea does not come into play often in Mass Effect 2 because the game does not have many easy battles (in general, dependent on many other factors of course).
<br><br>
	Most RPGs have experience points in one form or another, which is directed related to improving the character, and this is true for Mass Effect 2.  However, many single player RPGs (experience gain in MMORPGs is a very different discussion) handle experience gain poorly, and very few handle it well.  There is no completely "correct" way to design an experience system, so it would be inaccurate to say that Mass Effect 2 has the "best" experience system of any single player game, but it does have a well designed one.  Possibly the biggest variable in an experience system is the concept of being under-leveled, over-leveled, or the "right" level.  Some RPGs may have good reasons for allowing the player to easily become under-leveled or over-leveled, but usually this is poor game design that has been repeated too often over the years.  In these types of RPGs, many players will become obsessed with constantly wondering if they are the correct level for their current progress in the game.  The more the player thinks about this, the less they are thinking about other aspects of the game, usually making the game less enjoyable overall.  When under-leveled, the player may end up in a situation that feels impossible or is much more frustrating to deal with than the designers intended.  As an added note, some players like to purposely play RPGs under-leveled to make the game more challenging, but this should be made up for in other ways, such as having harder difficulty settings or specific challenges (such as ones commonly found in achievements).  When over-leveled, the combat of the game may become boring to the player because it takes little effort or thought to win a battle.
<br><br>
	A well designed RPG will loosely keep the player's character in a desired level range for most areas in the game.  Mass Effect 2 does this by awarding the majority of experience from completing missions rather than on a per enemy basis.  This works well in Mass Effect 2's case because most enemies can not be easily skipped, so the player is defeating them either way.  Enemies are seen by the player as obstacles in the mission, rather than piles of experience.  Main missions give roughly one level worth of experience, while completing several optional missions will also give a level worth of experience.  This allows for some variance in character level, but the player should be much less concerned about being under-leveled or over-leveled than most other RPGs.  Of course it is important to remember that this is only one example of a well designed experience system, not the only, and it wouldn't fit as well into every RPG.
<br><br>
	Mass Effect 2 has a few interesting customization designs.  When a character gains a level, they gain a talent point to invest in ranking up an ability, which by itself is not an unusual design for an RPG.  Each rank of an ability costs a number of talent points equal to its rank (1 point for rank 1, 2 more points to increase to rank 2, etc.).  At first thought, this system encourages spreading points between all of the abilities for efficient point spending, while increasing none to the max rank.  The opposite is encouraged by giving the final rank of each skill a choice between two greatly increased effects for the ability.  This makes both spreading out points and specializing points to reach final ranks viable options.  Also, all AI team members level up even when not being used, allowing for switching party members throughout the game, rather than being more or less committed to using party members chosen early on.  As additional customization, secondary outfits are unlocked for each team member after gaining their loyalty.  The player can choose the armor and clothes appearance of the main character as well.  This is something that games nowadays are allowing more and more.  Players really seem to enjoy having this kind of customization, and since it doesn't directly take anything away from the game, it is usually a good bonus to have.
<br><br>
	Mass Effect 2 has so much gameplay and other elements to think about, that it is easy to overlook some of the more subtle, but still well designed aspects.  One such area of design that has often been neglected by games in the past is what non-combat NPCs, such as quest givers and vendors, do while the player is not interacting with them.  Mass Effect 2 practically sets a benchmark for how RPGs should handle this.  For starters, NPCs will talk to other NPCs.  When doing so, they do not have a generic one line of speech that they then repeat.  The dialogue between NPCs, which a player can choose to eavesdrop on, is usually both interesting and long.  Sometimes NPCs will call the player over to them, which the player can choose to ignore or oblige.  Furthermore, even if two NPCs are talking, sometimes approaching one from the side will cause that NPC to turn and/or gesture towards the player.  There are two other important features that make the player feel like he is in a realistic environment rather than surrounded by character models with predetermined dialogue.  One is that NPC voices get louder and softer as the player moves closer and farther away from them.  Something this simple adds a new level of depth to the gaming experience, but is often neglected during game design.  The other is that NPCs are unpredictable in the same ways as strangers in a public place in the real world.  Some NPCs have nothing to say, some are in the middle of intense conversations (such as a vendor and customer in a market), some start conversations with the player, some tell the player to go away, and some even have history with party members.  It is common to hear different things when running past the same NPC as well.
<br><br>
	The amazing part of Mass Effect 2 is that these are only a handful of the design elements and game mechanics.  If I were to play through the game several more times, I would undoubtedly learn about and understand many other features to analyze, along with having a very different gameplay experience each time.  For example, one of the biggest features in Mass Effect 2 is the class system, which could be analyzed by itself for an extensive period of time.
